<br/><br/>  

In terms of articles, we allow the following:

</ul>  

In terms of stories, we do not allow the following:  
<ul>  
  <li>AI-generated stories, as we aim to publish meaningful stories based on real-life experiences or imagination,</li>  
  <li>stories copied from other sources, as we only accept original stories written by real people,</li>  
  <li>and stories that include excessive personal information about someone, as we value user privacy.</li>  
</ul>  

We do allow the following types of stories:  
<ul>  
  <li>fictional or non-fictional stories, as long as they are original. A fictional story can be based on real-life events but should not exceed what is scientifically possible.

  <li>and real-life stories, provided that the names, events, and places are altered to ensure privacy,</li>
